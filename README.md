# houseIoT

This repository contains all the Internet of Things (iOT) sensors
and servers at my house. It is highly unlikely that anybody can use
this as is but there are probably many components that can be reused
by others.

My ambition is to track a number of issues at my house and have
a nice set of dashboards to analyze them over time. Here is my current
list of things to be tracked:

* Internet speed and quality to keep my service provider honest.
* Temperature and humidity in my crawlspace. We've spend a fortune
keeping the humidity under control and I want to make sure our
investments are paying off. This solution can be used to track
temperature and humidity in any part of your house.
* Temperature and humidity in my attic. This is just for shits and
giggles. It gets really hot there in the summer and cold in the winter.
It would be nice to know what the numbers are and see if more insulation
could keep heating/cooling cost down.
* Air quality in my living room in terms of CO2 and particles to
see what the effect of my fireplace is.
* My outdoor weather station that keeps track of outdoor temperature,
humidity, rainfall, wind speed, wind direction and UV light.
